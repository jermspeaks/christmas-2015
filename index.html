        <p>Dear <span class="placeholder-name"></span>,</p>
        <p>Following annual tradition, I would like to invite you to join my Christmas Card mailing list. Can you please reply to this email an address I can send the holiday gift to?</p>

        <p>This year, I'm doing something extra special. I'm painting two large canvases, cutting them up in little cards, and sending apiece to you! Along with that, I'm typing a personal letter to you using an old Olivetti electric typewriter. To make it extra special, I'm using old dot matrix printer paper. You can read more about it <a href="http://tinyletter.com/jeremywong/letters/christmas-in-october" >here</a>.</p>

        <p>If you haven't done so already, I write a weekly newsletter called "The Jear Bear Letters". You should totally <a href="http://tinyletter.com/jeremywong">subscribe</a>!</p>

        <p>Hope everything has been going well for you. I would love to hear back from you soon.</p>

        <p>Please reply to this letter via <a href="mailto:jermspeaks@gmail.com?subject=Holiday Cards And You">email</a>.</p>

        <p>Happy Holidays,</p>
        <p>Jeremy Wong</p>
